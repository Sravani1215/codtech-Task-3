## Overview of the project:
### Project Overview: Java File Operations

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to demonstrate a multithreaded client-server chat system in Java, including:
##### **=>** Build a functional client-server chat system in Java.
##### **=>** Enable multiple clients to connect and chat in real time.
##### **=>** Use multithreading to handle multiple users simultaneously.
##### **=>** Implement message broadcasting to all connected clients.
##### **=>** Demonstrate practical use of Java sockets in network programming.

### Key Activities:
##### **=>** Set up a Java socket-based server to accept multiple client connections.
##### **=>** Implement multithreading to handle each client independently.
##### **=>** Develop client-side code for sending and receiving messages.
##### **=>** Test real-time communication between multiple clients.

### Technologies Used:
##### **=>** Java SE
##### **=>** Java Sockets (java.net package)
##### **=>** Multithreading (java.lang.Thread)
##### **=>** IDE (Eclipse / IntelliJ / NetBeans)

### Conclusion:
##### **=>** Establishing real-time communication between server and multiple clients.
##### **=>** Using Java sockets fornetwork data transfer.
##### **=>** Implementing multithreading to handle multiple users concurrently.
##### **=>** Broadcasting messages to all connected clients.
##### **=>** Demonstrating core concepts of network programming in Java.
